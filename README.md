# React Clicky Game
CLICKY-GAME is a memory game built with React.js. The goal of the game is simple, using your mouse, CLICK each of the twelve Dragon Ball Z character cards in whatever order you chose - the order does not matter, only that you do not click the same card twice!

# What is this game about?
This is a simple memorization and click game. The object of the game is to click on only one character once. If you repeat guesses, you lose and the score is reset to 0. You win by reaching the max score total of 12.

# Packages Setup
1. npm init => initialize package.json
2. npm install => create package-lock.json
3. npm i react-router-dom => install **[react-router-dom package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)**
4. react-script =>npm i react-scripts **[react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts)**

# How to Play:
- Click on any character tile you desire
- The tiles will all reshuffle themselves
- Click on another character, but REMEMBER that you can only click on a character once.
- Keep going to see if you can get all 12.
